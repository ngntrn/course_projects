	<hr>

	<h3 class = "well_name"> Artsy.net</h3>
	<hr>
	<p> The Artsy website catalogues the world's art, consisting of both modern and contemporary works and related information. The site contains 500,000 images of art, architecture and design by 50,000 artists, providing a Pandora (for music) and Netflix (for film)-like art discovery service. Not only is this site changing the way art is discovered, it is also changing how art is bought and sold by providing educational content and details for galleries to make it easier for collectors to buy the art.
